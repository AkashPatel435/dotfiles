(currently using gideonwolfe's method) instead of templating

picom
-exclude apps for blur (full screen ff and video/image viewers)
-shadow on polybar

walset
-add a rofi way of changing themes

resolution settings
-1080 4 lyfe

gtk
-change colors on the fly
-i think oomox now supports arc theme
-and wal has oomox support
- wpgtk

polybar
-borders or maybe should i just make it into one bar
--past me too smart
--just try more stuff/config/designs
-gaps b/t wrkspc (nah its okay p much decided defeat)
-c|fs|ft (make individual buttons)
maybe just don't worry about polybar and wait for the wayland revolution
waybar

vim
-separators
-lightline
--colors
-syntastic
-ctrlp
-multiple cursors

xrandr -o switcher script (p sure one is floating around on archlinux forums)
can i somehow access onboard imu?

zsh
--venv, conda env

tty
-blinking block cursor
-dvtm
--config
--status bar
-tmux
--just better multiplexing than dvtm
-byobu
--better than tmux?
-pictures and movies (this is hard)
-take a look at PyTerminalMediaViewer
--maybe get them to not be full screen

i3 (maybe just move away from i3)
-open empty workspaces via click
-floating windows snapping via click
--change coordinates in divvy script
-would love hot corners
-divvy

bpswm/sxhd
--that one gif
--empty node
--empty workspace
-jgmenu -??

windowchef
-take a look at it
-workspaces

music
-fix library

dunst
-mpd
--maybe include cover art
-screenshot
-also other types of music as well e.g. youtube soundcloud (mpris ig)

login ??
-use lock scren
-or can be fancy and use lightdm or slimdm?

lock screen
-update with new screenshot

refind minimal theme

cli radar (if i can get images just timg it) notcurses?

bug that darkgray does not equal 8 in neovim when setting ctermbg
https://siatwe.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/vim-ctermfg-and-ctermbg-color-values/

mod pywal to have diff background from color0
black is too black for me
like something more subdued

MUSIC POWER

flutter app for music playing local
and streaming sources (yt, sc) (animebytes, bandcamp, ...)
look at newpipeextractor for music backends
(https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor)
newpipe's frontend is p cool, https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe (android only)
closest we want: https://github.com/Sangwan5688/BlackHole/issues/39 labelled as wontfix

include soulseek dl/up to immediately listen once torrent finishes

automatic tagging with beets for local library/plex/kodi/funkwhale
automatic updating with lidarr for local library/plex/kodi/funkwhale

plex/funkwhale uploading as well
jellyfin

use our app to create local server on one device to have another connected
device stream/access music from

why user accounts?
cache'd playlists can be shared across devices
listening to same song (how to do dis?)

inspiration: nuclear-player

existing stuff
https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/flutter-apps/music-player
flutter music apps: flutter-netease-music
                    blackhole only android
foobar2000 extension plugin system
youtube music

blackhole has some dope features:
https://github.com/Sangwan5688/BlackHole#features

normalize sound audio form one song to next so you that user doesn't have to
fiddle with volume

add lyrics (romanized as well) with Genius
add videos

look at spicetifies extensions for additional features

flutter audio support:
https://github.com/ryanheise/just_audio/tree/minor/just_audio

spotify like peer-to-peer listen together

# END MUSIC POWER

Add tokyo night to wal https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim
Add catuppicin to wal

how to showcase the transformers card art
can stitch together both transformers but still need to made it widescreen
somehow
liquid rescaling
waifu2x?

take over the pypi package for united_states_congress
https://github.com/unitedstates/congress/pull/283

read atla notepad
nick's komga
pw: akashcomicbooks

btm: sort cpu by frequency instead of id look at cpufreq alias
use blocks (didn't work)
https://docs.rs/tui/latest/tui/symbols/enum.Marker.html
need to use a sparkline to fill in everything (maybe just for network)
use a guage for battery (cool if its circular) (its not circular but still
better than the current one
do some smoothing on the graphs, make its look cooler and smoother
add uptime?
turn on fans manually? https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fan_speed_control#ThinkPad_laptops
really scary tho, just reading/showing fans is prob a good start (this is like
the acceleration gauge) (gotta get those rpms!)

paru: use separate pacman.conf for chroot (how to handle the IgnorePkg)
https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru/issues/716

rofi for killing tasks (this would be a godsend tbh)

transparency stop on video / image viewers
and stop on full screen firefox

get cava gradient working with wal colors
cava mirror across xaxis (i dont think i would use this tbh)
use notcurses or more resolute unicode blocks with cava
it already has good resolution, but looks like the blocks are hardcoded to be
just one color

use cava colors horizontally like in this post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/ui7vk5/kde_plasma_kubuntu_2004/

add radius to wallpapers so that they look rounded and the empty space is
colored the same as laptop bezel
maybe even do shadow blur on the background wallpaper? like gnome 42 look

add other relevant benchmarks to the microbenchmark readme
https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/issues/1202

add sextent blitter unicode block mode/characters to timg
https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/block/U+2580
better yet just use notcurses as backend (https://notcurses.com/)

julia a_star alg improvements
julia use value iteration/policy iteration
create policyiteration package like discretevalueiteration

add more than 6 pin repos via github readme stats

spicetify dribbblish wal theme
vim /usr/share/spicetify-cli/Themes/Dribbblish/color.ini

use pywalfox colors for the darker shades required in element and spotify themes

when click time on polybar open up `cal -y`

To fix webgl in firefox on archlinux with nvidia:

polybar mute doesn't get reflected/triggered properly with pulse module

openfoam cfd
use gpus/hardware acceleration
current openfoam cfd doesn't use gpu in source
some plugins/forks like paralution and ripfoam

what backend solvers is it using? if gradient based can use autodiff
Example? https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/IcoFoam
A couple of grad calls made, which means autodiff would benefit
solvers: https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/user-guide/a-reference/a.1-standard-solvers
but this is still at a higher level compared to what actual solver algorithm is
choosen
here are the numerics for openfoam which has a section on Linear Equation
Solvers: https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/openfoam-guide-numerics.html
this is what I want to improve

so mesh numbering matrices are sparse, state of art is cuthill-mckee in cfd
can use sparse reordering methods from gtsam (nonlinear opt)
maybe these methods can improve ordering and subsequent optimization scheme for cfd
is the goal to reduce the bandwidth/profile or to reduce fill-in?

checkout colamd and symamd (symamd is just symmetric colamd) cfd mats are all
symmetric
compare cm vs rcm (rcm shoud be better with respect to decreasing fill in)
test and compare times

ch 5 kinda dope: https://doc.cfd.direct/notes/cfd-general-principles/contents
best method is preconditioned conjugate grad?

also why is cfd linear program and not nonlinear program?

parallelize pokeshell with GNU Parallels

dynamically change precision level during runtime of cfd sims

using graph neural networks to compute optimal fill in

blender doesn't show normal arrows
blender doesn't load .dae files
